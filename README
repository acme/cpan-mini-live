NAME
    CPAN::Mini::Live - Keep CPAN Mini up to date

SYNOPSIS
      # have a ~/.minicpanrc:
      # (change local to where you want the mirror)
      remote: http://cpan.cpantesters.org/
      exact_mirror: 1
      force: 0
      trace: 0
      class: CPAN::Mini::Live
      local: /home/acme/Public/minicpanlive/

      # then run the minicpan command:
      % minicpan
      updating mirror...
      and live...

DESCRIPTION
    CPAN::Mini creates a minimal mirror of CPAN and is very useful indeed.
    However, to keep the mirror up to date, you must continually run
    minicpan. This module makes minicpan block and listen for live updates,
    thus keeping your minicpan live.

    It works by having a backend running CPAN::Mini::Live::Publish which
    publishes file updates and deletions to FriendFeed.

    CPAN::Mini::Live listens to these updates using the FriendFeed real-time
    API so your minicpan will be kept up to date in real time.

    You have to use the same mirror as the backend code,
    <http://cpan.cpantesters.org/>.
