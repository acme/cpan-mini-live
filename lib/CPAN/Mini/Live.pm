=head1 NAME

CPAN::Mini::Live - Keep CPAN Mini up to date

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # have a ~/.minicpanrc:
  # (change local to where you want the mirror)
  remote: http://cpan.cpantesters.org/
  exact_mirror: 1
  force: 0
  trace: 0
  class: CPAN::Mini::Live
  local: /home/acme/Public/minicpanlive/

  # then run the minicpan command:
  % minicpan
  updating mirror...
  and live...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<CPAN::Mini> creates a minimal mirror of CPAN and is very useful
indeed. However, to keep the mirror up to date, you must continually
run minicpan. This module makes minicpan block and listen for live
updates, thus keeping your minicpan live.

It works by having a backend running L<CPAN::Mini::Live::Publish>
which publishes file updates and deletions to FriendFeed.

L<CPAN::Mini::Live> listens to these updates using the FriendFeed
real-time API so your minicpan will be kept up to date in real time.

You have to use the same mirror as the backend code,
L<http://cpan.cpantesters.org/>.
